# Users perception and experience of using payment apps

> ## Phase I - User Research

### 1. Problem statement
Our study aims to understand users' perceptions and experiences regarding **payment apps.** We seek to identify challenges users face, gauge satisfaction levels, and pinpoint areas for improvement in existing e-banking platforms. Additionally, we aim to investigate users' preferences for online transactions, their app usage patterns, preferred features, types of businesses they engage with using these apps, and the problems they encounter while using them.

### 2. Methodology
**Designed questions -> Data collection -> Interpretation of the data and analysis**

We designed a set of questions to evaluate user experience with e-banking apps, covering both **qualitative** and **quantitative** aspects. We collected data through a **Google Form survey** and **user interviews** to gather insights on app usability, satisfaction levels, and specific user preferences. Combining these methods enabled us to analyze both quantitative data, like app preferences, and qualitative data, such as user opinions and experiences, providing valuable insights into areas for improvement in e-banking apps.


### 3. Experiment / Study conducted
The experiment used both **_qualitative_** and **_quantitative_** methods to understand how people use e-banking apps and websites.

  **i. Google form survey:**
   - Created to gather quantitative data
   - Structured questions on user satisfaction, ease of use, feature preferences, and security concerns.
   - Enabled statistical analysis and complemented qualitative findings from interviews.
     
  **ii. User Interviews:**
   - Semi-structured interviews with 20 participants.
   - Conducted in person or remotely.
   - Provided qualitative insights into user experiences and preferences.
   - Offered specific feedback on e-banking apps.
   - Enhanced understanding beyond quantitative data alone.

### 4. Findings
Please refer to the attached _user research report_ for detailed findings.

### 5. Conclusion
The study on e-banking apps conducted through Google Form surveys and user
interviews reveals that the majority of participants, especially students, use these
platforms daily for tasks like bill payments and money transfers due to their
convenience and security. While users generally find e-banking apps easy to navigate,
technical issues such as transaction delays pose challenges, particularly with Google
Pay. However, most users express satisfaction with the security measures
implemented. Younger users are more engaged with rewards/offers, while privacy
concerns exist, primarily due to incidents like Paytm wallet closures. Improvement
suggestions include simpler interfaces and better customer support. Overall, the study
underscores the increasing significance of e-banking apps in the digital landscape and
emphasizes the importance of continuous enhancement to meet user expectations
effectively

> ## Phase II - Prototype

Based on our conducted user research and findings, we initially developed a paper prototype. Subsequently, we transitioned to creating a Figma prototype.

We retained familiar elements from Google Pay to ensure ease of use for our users. Additionally, we made modifications to certain UI aspects and introduced new features based on the feedback gathered from our research. The prototype aims to address identified user preferences and enhance overall user experience with e-banking apps.

### Indefied Problem:
 - **Complexity of Interface:** too much buttons and options on the main screen leading to confusion and frustration among the users
 - **Accessability:** difficulties in accessing some important and commonly used features

### Proposed Solution:
   **Paper Prototype** -> **Figma Prototype**
 - Simple User interface
 - Easy navigation for frequently used features
 - Added some more features which can make user experience better

Please find our **Figma prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/design/rDXzljo6bVdXSdzgEvQiWT/HCI_Wireframe?node-id=0-1&t=jy7jPXhOXswcDRz0-0).**
